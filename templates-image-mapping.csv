Crucial Command: This is a TOTAL space transformation project. The user's input image is for layout, structural, and perspective reference ONLY. ALL visible surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, exterior facades, landscapes) and existing elements (windows, doors, furniture, decor, vegetation) within the input image MUST BE COMPLETELY REPLACED or newly generated according to the specified style. No original textures, dirt, or unfinished elements from the input image should remain in the final output. The output must represent a fully finished, high-end, and professionally designed space.

Strictly retain the spatial structure, camera perspective, lighting direction, and main elements' positions (e.g., windows, doors, key architectural features) from the user's input image. If it's an interior, ensure realistic room proportions. If it's an exterior, maintain the architectural footprint and landscape contours.

The final output must be a professional-grade photograph, photorealistic, with exceptional attention to detail, harmonious composition, and an overall refined and high-end aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Living Room into a dreamy latte-style sanctuary featuring walls in warm cream or latte tones with smooth matte plaster finish, light natural oak or white-washed wood flooring with subtle grain, furniture with soft rounded edges in plush boucle fabric or velvet in rich caramel, oatmeal, and taupe tones, organic-shaped tables in light travertine stone or pale wood, layered textures including chunky knit throw blankets in ivory and velvet cushions, soft-pile area rug in warm beige tones, minimal decor with sculptural ceramic vases in neutral tones, dried pampas grass or natural branches, rounded arch doorways or curved architectural details where applicable, warm ambient lighting with modern fixtures in fabric or frosted glass, large windows with sheer linen curtains allowing soft diffused light, monochromatic palette of cream, latte, caramel, oatmeal, and soft taupe creating an Instagram-worthy cocoon of warmth and tactile comfort.


The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail, vibrant color accuracy, and exceptional dynamic range. Rendered with V-Ray or Corona Renderer.

For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Dining Room into a joyful dopamine-boosting paradise featuring walls painted in cheerful uplifting colors like soft coral, sunny yellow accent wall, or fresh sage green with white trim, light wood or painted flooring, furniture with playful shapes and vibrant upholstery in happy colors mixing coral, mint green, butter yellow, sky blue, and soft pink, colorful storage solutions and accessories, playful wall art with cheerful illustrations or colorful abstract pieces creating gallery wall, soft colorful area rug with geometric pattern or fun shapes, whimsical lighting like colorful pendant or sculptural fixtures, decorative elements like pom-pom garlands or colorful textiles, potted plants in colorful ceramic pots for touch of nature, window treatments in cheerful colors or patterns, overall vibrant energizing atmosphere that sparks creativity and happiness while remaining organized and functional, color-blocked walls or painted geometric shapes as focal points.


The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail, vibrant color accuracy, and exceptional dynamic range. Rendered with V-Ray or Corona Renderer.

Crucial Command: This is a TOTAL space transformation project. The user's input image is for layout, structural, and perspective reference ONLY. ALL visible surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, exterior facades, landscapes) and existing elements (windows, doors, furniture, decor, vegetation) within the input image MUST BE COMPLETELY REPLACED or newly generated according to the specified style. No original textures, dirt, or unfinished elements from the input image should remain in the final output. The output must represent a fully finished, high-end, and professionally designed space.

Strictly retain the spatial structure, camera perspective, lighting direction, and main elements' positions (e.g., windows, doors, key architectural features) from the user's input image. If it's an interior, ensure realistic room proportions. If it's an exterior, maintain the architectural footprint and landscape contours.

The final output must be a professional-grade photograph, photorealistic, with exceptional attention to detail, harmonious composition, and an overall refined and high-end aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Laundry Room into an organic modern sanctuary featuring walls in natural stone tiles such as beige travertine or limestone with subtle texture, or smooth plaster in warm cream tones, flooring in large-format natural stone tiles or wide-plank wood with matte finish, furniture in natural light wood like oak or teak with organic curved forms and live edge details, natural fiber elements like woven baskets and linen textiles in neutral tones, sculptural lighting fixtures inspired by nature, potted plants for greenery, organic wood accessories, warm ambient lighting, abundant natural light, color palette of warm whites, beiges, soft grays, natural wood tones, and organic textures, overall atmosphere of serene spa-like tranquility with strong connection to nature through organic materials, curved forms, and biophilic design elements.


The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail, vibrant color accuracy, and exceptional dynamic range. Rendered with V-Ray or Corona Renderer.

Crucial Command: This is a TOTAL space transformation project. The user's input image is for layout, structural, and perspective reference ONLY. ALL visible surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, exterior facades, landscapes) and existing elements (windows, doors, furniture, decor, vegetation) within the input image MUST BE COMPLETELY REPLACED or newly generated according to the specified style. No original textures, dirt, or unfinished elements from the input image should remain in the final output. The output must represent a fully finished, high-end, and professionally designed space.

Strictly retain the spatial structure, camera perspective, lighting direction, and main elements' positions (e.g., windows, doors, key architectural features) from the user's input image. If it's an interior, ensure realistic room proportions. If it's an exterior, maintain the architectural footprint and landscape contours.

The final output must be a professional-grade photograph, photorealistic, with exceptional attention to detail, harmonious composition, and an overall refined and high-end aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Home Theater into a quiet luxury haven featuring walls in sophisticated neutral tones like taupe, greige, warm gray, or subtle mushroom with premium smooth or micro-textured finish, flooring in wide-plank engineered hardwood in medium to dark tone or plush wall-to-wall carpet in neutral beige, statement furniture with elegant proportions in luxurious fabrics like bouclé, premium linen, or velvet in caramel, cream, or soft gray, exquisite textiles in high thread-count materials with subtle texture, investment-quality pieces with refined hardware in brushed brass or polished nickel, sculptural lighting with natural stone or ceramic bases, museum-quality art in earth tones, custom window treatments with motorized shades and floor-length drapery, carefully curated minimal decor including artisan vessels, hardcover books, single orchid or sculptural branch, handwoven area rug in neutral tones with exceptional quality, attention to proportion and negative space, impeccable craftsmanship evident in every detail, overall aesthetic of understated elegance, timeless refinement, and investment-quality materials creating space that whispers rather than shouts luxury through superior quality, craftsmanship, and restraint.


The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail, vibrant color accuracy, and exceptional dynamic range. Rendered with V-Ray or Corona Renderer.

ALL visible surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, exterior facades, landscapes) and existing elements (windows, doors, furniture, decor, vegetation) within the input image MUST BE COMPLETELY REPLACED or newly generated according to the specified style. No original textures, dirt, or unfinished elements from the input image should remain in the final output. The output must represent a fully finished, high-end, and professionally designed space.

Strictly retain the spatial structure, camera perspective, lighting direction, and main elements' positions (e.g., windows, doors, key architectural features) from the user's input image. If it's an interior, ensure realistic room proportions. If it's an exterior, maintain the architectural footprint and landscape contours.

The final output must be a professional-grade photograph, photorealistic, with exceptional attention to detail, harmonious composition, and an overall refined and high-end aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Bathroom into a Scandinavian hygge haven with crisp white painted walls, light oak or birch wood plank flooring with natural matte finish, functional simple furniture with clean lines including light-colored upholstered pieces with wooden legs, light wood tables and storage, cozy textiles like chunky knit throw blankets and soft wool cushions in neutral tones, minimal decor with Nordic ceramics and candleholders, strategically placed potted houseplants, abundant natural light streaming through sheer white curtains, muted color pops in dusty pink or sage green, overall atmosphere of warmth, simplicity, and effortless comfort with focus on functionality and natural materials.


The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail, vibrant color accuracy, and exceptional dynamic range. Rendered with V-Ray or Corona Renderer.

The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Crucial Command: This is a TOTAL space transformation project. The user's input image is for layout, structural, and perspective reference ONLY. ALL visible surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, exterior facades, landscapes) and existing elements (windows, doors, furniture, decor, vegetation) within the input image MUST BE COMPLETELY REPLACED or newly generated according to the specified style. No original textures, dirt, or unfinished elements from the input image should remain in the final output. The output must represent a fully finished, high-end, and professionally designed space.

Strictly retain the spatial structure, camera perspective, lighting direction, and main elements' positions (e.g., windows, doors, key architectural features) from the user's input image. If it's an interior, ensure realistic room proportions. If it's an exterior, maintain the architectural footprint and landscape contours.

The final output must be a professional-grade photograph, photorealistic, with exceptional attention to detail, harmonious composition, and an overall refined and high-end aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Powder Room into a bohemian eclectic paradise with warm earthy-toned walls, layered vintage rugs over natural flooring, low comfortable seating with colorful patterned cushions and throws, mix of vintage and handcrafted furniture, abundant layered textiles in rich patterns mixing ikat, suzani, and tribal prints, macramé wall hangings and woven baskets, floor cushions and poufs, abundance of hanging and potted plants, warm ambient lighting from lanterns and string lights, global artifacts and handmade ceramics, relaxed, lived-in, free-spirited atmosphere full of personality and texture.


The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail, vibrant color accuracy, and exceptional dynamic range. Rendered with V-Ray or Corona Renderer.

No original textures, dirt, or unfinished elements from the input image should remain in the final output. The output must represent a fully finished, high-end, and professionally designed space.

Strictly retain the spatial structure, camera perspective, lighting direction, and main elements' positions (e.g., windows, doors, key architectural features) from the user's input image. If it's an interior, ensure realistic room proportions. If it's an exterior, maintain the architectural footprint and landscape contours.

The final output must be a professional-grade photograph, photorealistic, with exceptional attention to detail, harmonious composition, and an overall refined and high-end aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Dining Room into a sleek contemporary space featuring clean lines, neutral color palette, mix of textures, modern furniture with simple forms, minimal accessories, quality materials, large windows with simple treatments, open and airy feel, current design trends executed with restraint, sophisticated and polished aesthetic.


The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail, vibrant color accuracy, and exceptional dynamic range. Rendered with V-Ray or Corona Renderer.

Crucial Command: This is a TOTAL space transformation project. The user's input image is for layout, structural, and perspective reference ONLY. ALL visible surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, exterior facades, landscapes) and existing elements (windows, doors, furniture, decor, vegetation) within the input image MUST BE COMPLETELY REPLACED or newly generated according to the specified style. No original textures, dirt, or unfinished elements from the input image should remain in the final output. The output must represent a fully finished, high-end, and professionally designed space.

Strictly retain the spatial structure, camera perspective, lighting direction, and main elements' positions (e.g., windows, doors, key architectural features) from the user's input image. If it's an interior, ensure realistic room proportions. If it's an exterior, maintain the architectural footprint and landscape contours.

The final output must be a professional-grade photograph, photorealistic, with exceptional attention to detail, harmonious composition, and an overall refined and high-end aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Home Office into an industrial loft with exposed red brick walls showing authentic texture, polished concrete flooring, exposed black metal pipes and ductwork on ceiling, tall windows with black metal frames, distressed leather furniture in cognac or black, reclaimed wood and metal tables with visible welds, vintage metal factory pendant lights with Edison bulbs, metal shelving units, neutral color scheme of gray, black, brown, and rust, minimal but impactful vintage industrial decor, raw urban aesthetic with refined finishing touches.


The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail, vibrant color accuracy, and exceptional dynamic range. Rendered with V-Ray or Corona Renderer.

Crucial Command: This is a TOTAL space transformation project. The user's input image is for layout, structural, and perspective reference ONLY. ALL visible surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, exterior facades, landscapes) and existing elements (windows, doors, furniture, decor, vegetation) within the input image MUST BE COMPLETELY REPLACED or newly generated according to the specified style. No original textures, dirt, or unfinished elements from the input image should remain in the final output. The output must represent a fully finished, high-end, and professionally designed space.

Strictly retain the spatial structure, camera perspective, lighting direction, and main elements' positions (e.g., windows, doors, key architectural features) from the user's input image. If it's an interior, ensure realistic room proportions. If it's an exterior, maintain the architectural footprint and landscape contours.

The final output must be a professional-grade photograph, photorealistic, with exceptional attention to detail, harmonious composition, and an overall refined and high-end aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Kids Room into a retro vintage space featuring furniture and decor from specific past eras (50s-70s), bold patterns and colors from the period, vintage lighting fixtures, nostalgic accessories, mix of authentic and reproduction pieces, playful atmosphere with period-specific charm.


The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail, vibrant color accuracy, and exceptional dynamic range. Rendered with V-Ray or Corona Renderer.

ALL visible surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, exterior facades, landscapes) and existing elements (windows, doors, furniture, decor, vegetation) within the input image MUST BE COMPLETELY REPLACED or newly generated according to the specified style. No original textures, dirt, or unfinished elements from the input image should remain in the final output. The output must represent a fully finished, high-end, and professionally designed space.

Strictly retain the spatial structure, camera perspective, lighting direction, and main elements' positions (e.g., windows, doors, key architectural features) from the user's input image. If it's an interior, ensure realistic room proportions. If it's an exterior, maintain the architectural footprint and landscape contours.

The final output must be a professional-grade photograph, photorealistic, with exceptional attention to detail, harmonious composition, and an overall refined and high-end aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Dining Room into a Mediterranean retreat featuring textured walls in warm whites or terra cotta, terracotta tile or natural stone flooring, arched doorways and windows, wrought iron details, natural wood furniture, blue and white ceramics, plants in terracotta pots, warm color palette, rustic elegance, indoor-outdoor living connection.

Crucial Command: This is a TOTAL space transformation project. The user's input image is for layout, structural, and perspective reference ONLY. ALL visible surfaces (walls, floors, ceilings, exterior facades, landscapes) and existing elements (windows, doors, furniture, decor, vegetation) within the input image MUST BE COMPLETELY REPLACED or newly generated according to the specified style. No original textures, dirt, or unfinished elements from the input image should remain in the final output. The output must represent a fully finished, high-end, and professionally designed space.

Strictly retain the spatial structure, camera perspective, lighting direction, and main elements' positions (e.g., windows, doors, key architectural features) from the user's input image. If it's an interior, ensure realistic room proportions. If it's an exterior, maintain the architectural footprint and landscape contours.

The final output must be a professional-grade photograph, photorealistic, with exceptional attention to detail, harmonious composition, and an overall refined and high-end aesthetic. The image should evoke a sense of aspiration and sophisticated comfort, suitable for features in leading design publications like ""Architectural Digest,"" ""Elle Decor,"" or ""Ark Journal.""

Employ soft, natural, and inviting lighting. For interiors, envision ample diffused natural light from large windows, supplemented by warm, well-placed accent lighting. For exteriors, aim for golden hour or clear daylight with balanced shadows. The atmosphere should be serene, pure, and enhance the specified style.

Transform this Home Gym into a brutalist space featuring raw concrete surfaces, exposed structural elements, monolithic forms, minimal ornamentation, monochromatic color scheme, industrial materials, dramatic use of light and shadow, bold geometric shapes, overall aesthetic of raw architectural honesty.


The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail, vibrant color accuracy, and exceptional dynamic range. Rendered with V-Ray or Corona Renderer.
