Strictly retain the spatial structure, window and door positions, and ceiling height from the user's input image. The final output must be a professional interior photograph, photorealistic, with a sophisticated and serene quality, possessing the bright, aspirational, and highly shareable aesthetic of a top-trending image on Pinterest.com. The aesthetic must feel calm, architectural, and meticulously detailed with a sense of quiet luxury. Within this framework, transform the space into a high-end, Modern Small Space interior optimized for compact living that is directly inspired by the provided target style image. Architectural Finishes: Render the existing walls in bright white or very light gray to maximize sense of space with optional mirror panels or reflective surfaces to create depth. Install light-colored flooring in pale wood or large light gray tiles that visually expands the space. Add recessed LED lighting with multiple zones for flexible illumination and wall-mounted fixtures to save floor space. Furniture & Decor: Introduce a compact modern sofa or loveseat with slim profile and exposed legs to create visual lightness, in light neutral colors. Include space-saving multi-functional furniture like ottoman with storage or nesting coffee tables in glass or light wood. Add floating wall-mounted shelves instead of bulky bookcases. Keep furniture pieces minimal and appropriately scaled. Use a small area rug or none to avoid breaking up floor space. Decor must be minimal and purposeful: few carefully chosen accessories, wall-mounted art, vertical plants, and mirrors to expand space perception. Window treatments should be simple roller shades or sheer curtains to maximize natural light. Lighting & Atmosphere: The main lighting must be bright and layered with recessed ceiling lights, wall sconces, and one slim floor lamp. Add LED strip lighting under floating furniture. The atmosphere is open, airy, and surprisingly spacious with smart design choices that maximize every square meter through light colors, strategic furniture placement, and clever storage solutions. The final image must be of Hasselblad quality, photorealistic, with extreme detail and vibrant color accuracy, as if rendered with Corona Renderer for maximum realism in lighting and materials.
